We got an opportunity to meet and interview Mr Pavan C, an engineer based out of Bengaluru who owns the popular Jawa 42 motorcycle. Following are the transcript of our conversation with him.


**What made you buy the new Jawa 42 motorcycle?**

I always wanted to own a motorcycle with higher capacity engine and also the one which has got an appealing and retro design. I felt Jawa 42 is the right choice to make.

**Is the new bike meeting you and your family's expectation?**

Absolutely

**A specific feature or character in this motorcycle which made you own this?**

Firstly, the motorcycle's color scheme impressed me - the Red color with golden combination - it is stunning. Secondly, as said earlier, the motorcycle follows the retro design - Be it the JAWA logo and badging, the classic halogen headlight, the overall body. Thirdly, the sound of the motorcycle, the thump and exhaust note.

**What was your previous motorcycle**

My first motorcycle is Hero CBZ 150. As of Today, It is a 14-year old motorcycle. I have spent good time with CBZ, the most memorable being a trip to Nandi Hills with friends. I have not sold the motorcycle, It is still with me.

**Have you made any modifications to Jawa 42**

Yes, I have opted for a different seats than which comes as a default. I have also changed the rear suspension positioning as per my liking. The "Forty Two" radiator cover, a new tank cover are some of the new additions which I have made to the motorcycle.

**What's your farthest trip (Max Trip Meter reading)?**

It is 500 Kms - 250 kms upwards and 250 downwards. I have done about 5000 kms in total since owning the Jawa 42.

*Note: Pavan C still enjoys riding his outgoing bike Hero CBZ as he has so many memories associated with it. He intends to create many more memories with Jawa 42*
