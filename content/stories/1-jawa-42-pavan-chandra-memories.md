We got an opportunity to meet and interview Mr Pavan Chandra, an engineer based out of Bengaluru who owns the popular Jawa 42 motorcycle. Following are the transcript of conversation.


**What made you buy the new Jawa 42 motorcycle?**

I always wanted to own a motorcycle with higher capacity engine and also the one which has got an appealing and retro design. I felt Jawa 42 is the right choice to make. 


**Is the new bike meeting you and your family's expectation?**

Absolutely

**A specific feature or character in this motorcycle which made you own this?**

Firstly, the motorcycle's color scheme impressed me - the Red color with golden combination - it is stunning. Secondly, as said earlier, the motorcycle follows the retro design - Be it the JAWA logo and badging, the classic halogen headlight, the overall body. Thirdly, the sound of the motorcycle, the thump and exhaust note.

**What was your previous motorcycle**

My first motorcycle is Hero CBZ 150. As of Today, It is a 14-year old motorcycle. I have spent good time with CBZ, the most memorable being a trip to Nandi Hills with friends. I have not sold the motorcycle, It is still with me.

Yes, I have opted for a different seats than which comes as a default. I have also changed the rear suspension positioning as per my liking. The "Forty Two" radiator cover, a new tank cover are some of the new additions which I have made to the motorcycle.
