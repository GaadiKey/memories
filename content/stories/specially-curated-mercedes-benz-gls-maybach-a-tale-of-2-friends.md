**The story of two friends since 1968:**

As two extremely accomplished men in their respective fields, IITians Bharat and Amit's friendship dates back to 1968, when they shared the same hostel room in IIT Bombay. Both remained close friends through decades after college, as Bharat joined Daimler-Benz and Amit forayed into building his industry in Vadodara, after graduating from IIT. Amit always remained involved with Germany through his company's affiliation with Kuenkel-Wagner, a foundry equipment manufacturer in Hannover, Germany.

Though Amit and Geeta visited Bharat multiple times at Mercedes-Benz Germany, since 2015 onwards, Bharat convinced the Goradias into becoming staunch brand loyalists of the Three-Pointed Star. Influenced by the positive experience of using the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class himself, in the fall of 2021, Amit decided to gift his wife the global symbol of automotive excellence and motoring luxury in a SUV, the Maybach GLS, made in Tuscaloosa, USA. Bharat who was now a distinguished member of the University of Alabama stepped in to help his classmate make this the most special experience ever. The Mercedes-Benz US International team echoed Dr. Bala's desire to make this order an extremely special one, thus commencing a very rare journey of curating the vehicle from its production.

**Witnessing the 'Making of GLS Maybach' in Tuscaloosa, USA:**

Dr. Balasubramanian collaborated with MB USI team in Tuscaloosa and Mercedes-Benz AG team in Sindelfingen, Germany to document the making of the Maybach GLS. Given, the Maybach demands the ultimate perfection in automotive workmanship, only a few thousand Maybachs are handcrafted every year. Dr. Balasubramanian was invited by MBUSI to be a part of this exclusive experience, which he witnessed and documented, following all safety protocols and captured the stage-by-stage manufacturing of the ultimate in luxury automobile- A Mercedes-Maybach.

The luxury SUV was finally hand delivered on September 18^th^ 2022 to Ms. Geeta Goradia by Dr. Balasubramanian who travelled from Tuscaloosa to Vadodara, alongside Martin Schwenk, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India.

Key Customizations available in the Mercedes-Maybach GLS personalized for Amit Goradia:

-   **Color:** Hyacinth Red Metallic Color
-   **E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL:** The vehicle benefits from a fully active e-suspension, which has been redeveloped from the ground up. It is able to assess the road conditions, speed and load. For this, the high-performance control units analyse the driving conditions 1000 times per second. Damping and level control are automatically adjusted for each wheel accordingly and this results in outstanding ride comfort and excellent stability on any road condition.
-   **Burmester® high-end 3D surround sound system:** It produces a high-end audiophile experience with 26 speakers and a system output of 1610 W. It conducts the system like a personal orchestra in a concert hall.
-   **MBUX Rear Seat Entertainment System:** Films, music, photos, internet, or video games -- the system features diverse interfaces for the use of external media.
-   **MAGIC Vision Control:** Greater visibility, greater safety: the innovative MAGIC VISION CONTROL system ensures perfect visibility -- even during the wiping process. It makes use of intelligent, heated water ducts in the windscreen wipers. These spray washer fluid directly onto the windscreen in front of the wiper blades -- precisely where it is needed.

The digital (60Sec) and television spots (30 Sec) that follow, also convey Ford’s Feels-Like- Family commitment message, using the power of emotional storytelling.
