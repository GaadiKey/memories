Secondly, as said earlier, the motorcycle follows the retro design - Be it the JAWA logo and badging, the classic halogen headlight, the overall body. Thirdly, the sound of the motorcycle, the thump and exhaust note.</p><p><img src="https://drive.gaadikey.com/api/photo/IMG_7275_JROUsCUA.jpg?token=1LRbjF1M" alt="Jawa 42 and Pavan Chandra"></p><p><strong>What was your previous motorcycle</strong></p><p>My first motorcycle is Hero CBZ 150. As of Today, It is a 14-year old motorcycle. I have spent good time with CBZ, the most memorable being a trip to Nandi Hills with friends. I have not sold the motorcycle, It is still with me.</p><p><img src="https://drive.gaadikey.com/api/photo/IMG_7252_Ku7TXxlS.jpg?token=1LRbjF1M" alt="Jawa 42 Side View"></p><p><strong>Have you made any modifications to Jawa 42</strong></p><p>Yes, I have opted for a different seats than which comes as a default. I have also changed the rear suspension positioning as per my liking. The &ldquo;Forty Two&rdquo; radiator cover, a new tank cover are some of the new additions which I have made to the motorcycle.</p><p><img src="https://drive.gaadikey.com/api/photo/IMG_7238_S81Y1xVC.jpg?token=1LRbjF1M" alt="Jawa 42 Photo 1"></p><p><strong>Where do you like to take your new bike? Your dream destination?</strong></p><p>Dream destination? Well, my motorcycle (Jawa 42) decides what the final destination is.</p><p><img src="https://drive.gaadikey.com/api/photo/IMG_7287_GE1YAqnl.jpg?token=1LRbjF1M" alt="Jawa 42 logo Forty Two"></p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s your farthest trip (Max Trip Meter reading)?</strong></p><p>It is 500 Kms - 250 kms upwards and 250 downwards. I have done about 5000 kms in total since owning the Jawa 42.</p><p><em>Note: Pavan C still enjoys riding his outgoing bike Hero CBZ as he has so many memories associated with it. He intends to create many more memories with Jawa 42</em></p><p><img src="https://drive.gaadikey.com/api/photo/CBZ2_ZAkWWQ82.jpeg?token=1LRbjF1M" alt="CBZ 1">
